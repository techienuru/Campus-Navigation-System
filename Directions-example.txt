-----------------At a roundabout, directions are typically described using the positions of a clock to make it easier for drivers or pedestrians to understand. Here’s how the directions generally work:

1. **12 o’clock**: Go straight ahead (this is usually the exit directly opposite the entry point to the roundabout).
2. **3 o’clock**: Take the right exit.
3. **6 o’clock**: U-turn or go back the way you came (if it's possible in the roundabout).
4. **9 o’clock**: Take the left exit (the first left exit after entering the roundabout).

### Directions you could use in step-by-step navigation:
- **1st exit (9 o’clock)**: Take the left exit (usually the first exit).
- **2nd exit (12 o’clock)**: Go straight through the roundabout.
- **3rd exit (3 o’clock)**: Take the right exit (typically the third exit).
- **4th exit (6 o’clock)**: U-turn if it's a full roundabout and you need to go back.

Depending on the number of exits, you can also just refer to the first, second, or third exit for simplicity, especially when there are more than three exits.



-----------------If there is a roundabout on the route, you can adjust the step-by-step directions to include specific instructions for navigating the roundabout. Here’s how you can incorporate that, assuming there’s a roundabout and the person is to take the 9 o’clock exit (which is a left turn) on their way to the **Senate Building**:
